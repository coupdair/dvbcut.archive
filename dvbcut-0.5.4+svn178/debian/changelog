  [ Fabrice Coutadeur ]
  * Adapt package to use debhelper tiny form:
    + debian/rules:
      - use debhelper tiny form
      - Adapt dh_auto_configure target for automake build system
      - Delete generated files in override_dh_auto_clean to be able to build
        dvbcut locally twice
    + debian/dvbcut.menu: rename menu file to dvbcut.menu to makes it
      automatically installable by debhelper
    + debian/dvbcut.install: rename install file to dvbcut.install as stated in
      the debhelper manpage and Manually installs files to avoid the local
      update of the mime database
  * Change back build system to autotools so that qt4 patch can be adopted
    upstream (Closes: #656793).
    + debian/control:
      - Drop scons build dependency. It's not used anymore.
      - Drop cmake dependency
      - Added b-d on autoconf to generate configure script
      - Added b-d on pkg-config, used to get qt4 libs and includes
    + port-to-qt4.patch:
      - Drop cmake files from qt4 patch
      - Update configure and src/Makefile.in for qt4
    + This allows the automatic installation of desktop file and icon 
      (Closes: #660009)
  * Refresh fix-ftbfs-libav0.7 patch to use -pab as quilt arg. This makes futur
    refreshes lighter.
  * Rename docs to dvbcut.docs and manpages to dvbcut.manpages to follow
    debhelper recommendations. thanks bojo42 for the tip.
  * fix_gcc_4.7.patch: fix FTBFS with gcc 4.7 because of missing include.
    (Closes: #667154)
